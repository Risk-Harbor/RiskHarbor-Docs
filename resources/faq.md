### Is there a Risk Harbor token?

No, there is no Risk Harbor token at the moment. Please beware of any scams that claim so and closely follow our official channels to find out when we will be launching it.

### What is Risk Harbor?

Risk Harbor is a risk management marketplace for Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) that utilizes an entirely automated, transparent, and impartial claims process to protect liquidity providers and stakers against smart contract hacks and attacks. Users can purchase protection that shields them from either a basket of risks or individually selected risks that they want to protect against. This creates a personalized buying experience for users to curate their protection to fit a wide variety of unique risk profiles.

### How do I use Risk Harbor?

There are two ways to use the Risk Harbor protocol. First, a user can underwrite pools by depositing capital. In return, an underwriter receives premiums and tokens. Secondly, a user can purchase protection for a specific length of time in exchange for a percentage of tokens that they want to insure.

### How does Risk Harbor work?

Protection is underwritten by users who are also known as underwriters, who will have the ability to create a variety of unique protection pools with various custom parameters or have the opportunity to join existing pools created by other underwriters.

When users want to purchase protection, the total premium is paid upfront, and then a proportional amount is trickled down into the underwritersâ€™ pool every block. An underwriter can then withdraw their initial capital in addition to protection fees accrued proportional to both the capital staked, as long as their withdrawal maintains the minimum capital requirement of the pool.

When a protected contract is hacked, protected users or policyholders submit two transactions to the protection contract to file a claim and receive a payout. Again, the protocol's core feature is its entirely objective and automated, meaning claims can be paid out within three blocks of a hack or attack.

### Are there any fees?

No. Currently, there are no fees incorporated in the protocol.
