### Is there a Risk Harbor token?

No, there is no Risk Harbor token at the moment. Please beware of any scams that claim so and closely follow our official channels to find out when we will be launching it.

### What is Risk Harbor?

Risk Harbor is a risk management marketplace for decentralized finance \(DeFi\) that utilizes a completely automated, transparent, and impartial claims process to protect liquidity providers and stakers against smart contract hacks and attacks. Users can purchase protection that shields them from either a basket of risks or individually selected risks that they want to protect against. This creates a personalized buying experience for users to where they can curate their protection to fit a wide variety of unique risk profiles.

### How do I use Risk Harbor?

There are two ways to use the Risk Harbor protocol. First, a user is able to underwrite pools by depositing capital. In return, an underwriter receives premiums and tokens. Secondly, a user can purchase protection for a specific length of time in exchange for a percentage of tokens that they want to insure.

### How does Risk Harbor work?

Protection will be underwritten by users who are also known as underwriters, who will have the ability to create a variety of unique protection pools with a variety of custom parameters or have the opportunity to join existing pools created by other underwriters.

When users want to purchase protection, the total premium is paid upfront and then a proportional amount is trickled down into the underwritersâ€™ pool every block. An underwriter can then withdraw their initial capital in addition to protection fees accrued proportional to both the capital staked, as long as their withdrawal maintains the minimum capital requirement of the pool.

When a protected contract is hacked, protected users or policyholders submit two transactions to the protection contract to file a claim and receive a payout. Circling back to the core capability of the protocol, it is completely objective and automated, meaning the policyholders will be paid within three blocks of the hack itself.

### Are there any fees?

No, currently there are no fees incorporated in the protocol.
