# Underwriting

Underwriters are dripped premiums over time in exchange for providing cover and liquidity to the protocol. When providing cover, underwriters choose the **Price Point** at which they are willing to take exposure when they deposit capital into the pool. Underwriters can withdraw their capital if it is unutilized at any time.

This chart depicts the deposited underwriting capital at each price point. Once policyholders purchase, utilization will also be shown on this chart.
