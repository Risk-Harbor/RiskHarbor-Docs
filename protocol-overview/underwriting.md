# Underwriting

Underwriters are dripped premiums in exchange for providing cover to the protocol. When providing cover, underwriters choose the **Price Point** at which they are willing to take on the exposure when they deposit capital into the pool.

Underwriters can withdraw their capital if it is unutilized at any time.
