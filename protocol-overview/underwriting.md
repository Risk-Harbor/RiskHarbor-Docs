# Underwriting

Underwriters are dripped premiums over time in exchange for providing cover and liquidity to the protocol. When providing cover, underwriters choose the **Price Point** at which they are willing to take exposure when they deposit capital into the pool. Underwriters can withdraw their capital if it is unutilized at any time.
