# Filing a Claim

Filing a claim on risk harbor requires three steps. First, the Policyholder approves Second, the Policyholder transfers their claim tokens to the Claims Contract by calling the`startSwap`function. Third, after waiting at least one block, they call the`finishSwap`function. The finish swap function checks that the claim is valid and, if it is, sends the claim tokens to the underwriters and sends the payout to the policyholder.
