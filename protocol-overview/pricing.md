# Pricing & Purchasing

When underwriters deposit into the pool, they choose a **Price Point** at which they are willing to take on risk. The price point is the percentage of the total underwriting amount that a potential policyholder will pay when purchasing protection from the protocol. For example, if a user purchased 100 Dai worth of protection at a price point of 5%, they would pay 5 Dai upfront in premiums. Those premiums would be slowly dripped to the underwriters who had deposited at the five percent price point.

Potential policyholders observe the Price Points that are available and can buy at any Price Point with sufficient unutilized underwriting capital. If the Potential Policyholder wishes to purchase more protection than is available at one price point, he can split his order across multiple price points.
