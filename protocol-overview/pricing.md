# Pricing

When underwriters deposit into the pool, they choose a **Price Point** at which they are willing to take on risk. Potential policyholders observe this and can buy at any Price Point with sufficient unutilized underwriting capital. If the Potential Policyholder wishes to purchase more protection than is available at one price point, he can split his order across multiple price points.
