# Withdrawing

To withdraw your position from a Risk Harbor protection pool, you first need to have an underwriting position.

On the home page of the Risk Harbor app [here](https://app.riskharbor.com/home), you will be able to see your underwriting position. Select the position you want to withdraw from.

**Please note that if the pool matching your price point is fully utilized you will need to wait until someone deposits funds or wait until expiry.**

Once you select your position, you will see the pool page related to your position. Select the _underwriting_ tab, and _withdraw_ on the drop-down menu.

You will then need to select the position you wish to withdraw in the dropdown menu.

Enter the amount you wish to withdraw from a position and initiate the withdrawal process. Again, if youâ€™re unable to fully withdraw your position, it is because someone purchased protection from your underwritten position.

Once the _Start Withdraw_ transaction has been confirmed on Etherscan, you will have to wait 12 hours due to the withdrawal cooldown. We added this cooldown as an MEV and front-running protection mechanism. During this waiting period, the withdraw button will display the cooldown clock.

Once the countdown has been completed, you will be able to initiate the final _Withdraw_ transaction. You have a 12-hour window once the cooldown has concluded to finish your withdrawal. The button will then change to _Finish Withdraw_ as seen below. If not, you have missed the window and you will need to initiate the withdrawal again.
