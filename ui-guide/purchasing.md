# Purchasing

To purchase protection on Risk Harbor, you need to already own part of the position that you want to protect since premiums are paid in the credit token that you receive when you enter a position in the protected protocol. For example, if you want to purchase protection in the BarnBridge cUSDC pool you need to have some bb\_cUSDC already.

You should be on the **Protect** tab automatically but if not, click on it in the box on the right. 

### Step 2\) Purchase

Enter the amount of protection you want and click Purchase. This is a two-step process. You will need to approve the transfer of the premiums to the contract and then approve the purchase transaction.
