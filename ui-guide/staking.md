# Staking

### Stake your position to earn tickets

First, follow the Underwriting guide to get a stake-able position

{% page-ref page="underwriting.md" %}



Once you have an underwriting position, you are ready to stake your position and earn staking rewards. First, click on **stake** in the box on the right side of the screen.

Select the position that you wish to stake from the dropdown menu

Enter the amount that you want to stake from that position \(there is a max button if you want to stake all of it\). Then click the stake button at the bottom of the box. Again, this requires approving two transactions, one that approves the sending of your position tokens and the other that actually performs the staking function.
