# Underwriting & Staking

Underwriters at risk harbor earn premiums from policyholders and can stake to earn ticket rewards that will eventually be redeemable for governance tokens. This step-by-step guide walks you through how to underwrite in the BarnBridge cUSDC pool. 

All you need to start off is some USDC

### Step 1: Stake your USDC in yearn to receive yvUSDC

Navigate to [yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults) and click show on the USDC vault tab.

Approve the transaction using your wallet of choice. You now have yvUSDC in your wallet and are ready to deposit it into Risk Harbor. 

### Step2: Deposit the yvUSDC into the Risk Harbor Pool

Now navigate to [https://app.riskharbor.com/home](https://app.riskharbor.com/home) and select the pool that you want to add underwriting capital to.

Choose a price point to underwrite at \(the lower the price point, the higher your staking rewards will be\). Enter the amount of yvUSDC that you want to deposit and then click deposit. This is a two-step process that requires you to approve depositing your yvUSDC into the pool and then approve the deposit transaction itself. 

### Step3: Stake your position to earn tickets

Once you have deposited your yvUSDC you are ready to stake your position and earn staking rewards. First, click on **stake** in the box on the right side of the screen.

Select the position that you wish to stake from the dropdown menu

Enter the amount that you want to stake from that position \(there is a max button if you want to stake all of it\). Then click the stake button at the bottom of the box. Again this requires approving two transactions, one that approves the sending of your position tokens and the other that actually performs the staking function.
